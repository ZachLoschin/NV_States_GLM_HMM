Code for training a GLM-HMM for describing neurovascular states based on 
mesoscale Calcium and Hemoglobin fluorescent data.


NOTES:

Even with almost exactly correct initialization of the transition

parameters, the model will move away from these. The IRFs can fit very well

in any initialization now, but the transition probabilities aren't fitting.


Sometimes, if the transition probabilities are intialized to be the same at the beggining

then neither of them will ever update throughout training...



Haiku:

My code does not work

Calcium and oxygen

Your states elude me
